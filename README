Started working on a color picker for bootstrap: 

It's a simple rails app with a database of about 800 colors with this 
as the color table schema: 

  create_table "colors", :force => true do |t| 
    t.string  "name" 
    t.string  "w3c" 
    t.string  "hex" 
    t.integer "red" 
    t.integer "green" 
    t.integer "blue" 
    t.integer "hue" 
    t.integer "hsl_satur" 
    t.integer "hsl_light" 
    t.integer "hsv_satur" 
    t.integer "hsv_value" 
    t.string  "shade" 
  end 

The idea is not to have pre-defined palettes that an artist must pick 
and get stale.  i.e. popular palettes are used over and over and don't 
look original after awhile. But rather, let some programming logic 
pick colors and let a human click a button and review the picks over 
and over until they find a set that's awesome.  Here's 10 screen shots 
of different picks:

The logic is very simple right now.  The plan is to change the logic 
to use fields like hsl_satur and hue to make better choices.  Feedback 
appreciated, thanks.
